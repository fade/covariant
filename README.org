* Deaths per 100,000

16:36 <@Tuxedo> What I do is, I look up the population for the area in question and then work it out.
16:36 <@Tuxedo> So for instance, Mississauga's putative population is 828,854.
16:36 <@Tuxedo> So if X is the case count in question, then X / (828,854 / 100,000) is the count per 100K.
16:37 <@Tuxedo> Or X * (100,000 / 828,854) if you like that better.
16:38 <@Tuxedo> It's just a way of being able to compare counts between different reporting regions to see how bad it is.
