* Deaths per 100,000

1.  What I do is, I look up the population for the area in question and then work it out.
2. So for instance, Mississauga's putative population is 828,854.
3. So if X is the case count in question, then X / (828,854 / 100,000) is the count per 100K.
4. Or X * (100,000 / 828,854) if you like that better.
5. It's just a way of being able to compare counts between different reporting regions to see how bad it is.
